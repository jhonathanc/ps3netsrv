# ps3netsrv

ps3netsrv is a server application used to stream content from a remote server to the PS3.

Supports automatic decryption of encrypted PS3 ISO and folder conversion to PS3 ISO or standard ISO.

For more information: https://github.com/aldostools/webMAN-MOD/wiki/~-PS3-NET-Server

Command line syntax:
```
ps3netsrv  [rootdirectory] [port] [whitelist]

 Default port: 38008

 Whitelist: x.x.x.x, where x is 0-255 or *
 (e.g 192.168.1.* to allow only connections from 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.255)
```

ISO conversion / decryption command line syntax:
```
ps3netsrv  [game directory / encrypted iso] [PS3/ISO]
```

## Features

* Support up to 5 PS3 clients concurrently
* Configurable shared root directory (uses ps3netsrv path if the root directory is omitted)
* Configurable port (38008 is used by default if port is omitted)
* Start without command line parameters if GAMES, PS3ISO, PSXISO folders are found in ps3netsrv folder
* List local server IP addresses
* Remote IP address filtering: Whitelist IP addresses using wildcards
* Remote file operations (stat, open, create, read, close, delete, mkdir, rmdir)
* Remote directory listing (whole directory at once or by file) / include subdirectories
* List files in specified directory and all subdirectories if the path ends with //
* Merge multiple paths into a single directory (list paths in folder_name.INI)
* Streaming of ISO images (CD-ROM, CD-ROM XA, DVD, Bluray or PS3 Blurays)
* Detection of standard & non-standard CD sector sizes: 2048, 2352, 2336, 2448, 2328, 2368, 2340
* Multi-part ISO support (ISO images split as *.iso.0, *.iso.1, etc.)
* Realtime decryption of PS3 ISO images (3k3y & redump encrypted images)
* Realtime conversion of mounted folder to virtual ISO (vISO)
* Convert game folder or directory to local ISO file (drag & drop the ISO or folder for easy conversion)
* Decrypt encrypted PS3 ISO (using redump/3k3y encryption) into a new decrypted ISO

## Requirements

* A C/C++ compiler

* [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html)

* [mbed TLS](https://tls.mbed.org/)
  * Is being searched for in system library directory (e.g. `/usr/lib`) and custom directories specified in `LIBRARY_PATH`.
  If using a custom directory, put the path to the headers in `C_INCLUDE_PATH`.

`Meson` and `mbed TLS` are available as packages for most posix environments.

`Meson` and `mbed TLS` are not needed if using the Alternate building method.


## Building
**Warning**: *If you get "buffer overflow" errors on Linux, try to use the Alternate building method*

First configure a build directory:

```bash
$ meson buildrelease --buildtype=release
```

Then build using ninja:

```bash
$ ninja -C buildrelease
```

For further information see [Running Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/Running-Meson.html).

## Alternate building
To build ps3netsrv using the bundled POLARSSL library instead of mbed TLS and without Meson:
* use `_make.bat` on Windows 
* use `Make.sh` on Linux

On Linux this will statically link ps3netsrv.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install make
sudo apt-get install g++
./Make.sh
```

## Docker Container
